# MyFirstReact App

In this hands on I have created an react app and changed the ```App.js``` alone to just show the Single Page Application.

## Set up React environment

Created react app using the following commands.

``` bash

npm install -g creat-react-app

npx create-react-app myfirstreact

```

## App.js

In that ```App.js``` I have cleared all the default return page content and just added the heading content to return in web page.

``` js

import logo from './logo.svg';
import './App.css';

function App() {
  return (
    <center>
    <h1>Welcome to my first React app</h1>
    </center>
  );
}

export default App;

```

## Starting react app

I have started the react application using the following commmand.

``` bash

npm start

```
